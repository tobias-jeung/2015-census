# 2015-census

## Introduction ##
* The original 2015 US Census Demographic Dataset consists of 37 variables and 3220 obs. Some of the variables were Population size, income, and percentage of those in poverty. All the objects were the counties inC.
 
* New Dataset:                           
I created a new dataset consisting of only columns 187-244 which were the California counties in the dataset while retaining the 37 variables. I only wanted to focus on California counties in the data analysis. 



## Model Results ##
* Average county has more women than men
* Few counties have more than 1.5 milion
* Average Poverty percentage is 16.67%
* Median Income is high with 56,013
* Median Income is spread out on the distribution
* When the median income goes up the poverty percentage decreases with it
* Poverty percentage decreases when the Income per Capita increases
* Poverty increases hand in hand with unemployment
* Child Poverty increases hand in hand with unemployment
